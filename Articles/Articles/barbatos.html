            Ignore the amount of dust on my shelf. Please. <br><br>

            This is the Barbatos. I used to love to build this guy, but now everytime
            I see it in <a href="https://gundamevolution.com/en/">Gundam Evolutions</a>
            I scream. Like seriously, it could very well be the best Gundam in that game.
            However, I am glad to report that this particular model kit is AMAZING. The articulation
            is NUTS and the pieces never fall off. The only problem I have are that the weapons is
            cast in one colour of plastic. I guess you can fix that with painting. But, the anime's
            rendition of the weapons were silver, black, and grey. I am not complaining thought,
            this kit is amazing.
